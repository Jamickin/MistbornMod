- Improved draggable UI with invisible backgrounds for a cleaner look
- Option to hide button hints for even cleaner UI
- Distinctive zinc stalagmites rising from the surface in grass biomes
- Complete Mistborn experience with visual and sound effects

METALS & ABILITIES:
- Iron - Pull metals toward you or pull yourself toward metal anchors
- Steel - Push metals away or launch yourself by pushing against metal anchors
- Tin - Enhanced senses, night vision, and danger detection
- Pewter - Enhanced strength, defense, and physical abilities
- Zinc - Riot emotions of enemies, making them more vulnerable
- Brass - Soothe emotions of enemies, making them less aggressive
- Copper - Create a coppercloud that hides your Allomancy
- Bronze - Detect other Allomancers using metals
- Atium - Become temporarily invulnerable (extremely rare)

CONTROLS:
- Each metal has its own dedicated hotkey (customizable in Controls)
- Steel and Iron use "hold key" mechanics for dynamic movement
- Press [Left Alt] to FLARE actively burning metals
- Press [X] to DETECT metals without consuming reserves
- Press [M] to toggle the Metal Reserves UI display

ENHANCED UI SYSTEM:
- Fully draggable metal reserves display with invisible backgrounds
- Right-click bars to unlink individual metals
- Detailed metal reserves information with burn status
- Option to hide button hints in mod configuration
- Clean, minimalist appearance that doesn't obstruct gameplay

ZINC ORE:
- Find distinctive zinc stalagmites extending up to 25 blocks high from the surface
- Stalagmites now spawn less frequently and only in grass/forest biomes
- Highly visible ore formations that are easy to spot while exploring
- Unique generation makes finding zinc more rewarding
- Compatible with WorldGenPreviewer mod - watch the stalagmites form in real-time!
- Custom generation system ensures stalagmites aren't overwritten by terrain

BUGS:
- Moving the bars around and unlinking them does not save the position. Change something in the modconfig and then save config for the positions/linked status to change
For fans of the Mistborn series and anyone who wants a new magic system with unique mobility and combat options!
