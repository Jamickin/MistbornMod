FLARING: Press [LeftAlt] when burning metals to increase their power! 
Flaring doubles the effectiveness of all metals but also doubles consumption rate.

METAL RESERVES: Your body can hold a limited amount of metal! Each vial gives you 60 seconds of reserves,
and you can store up to 6 vials worth of metals total. Toggle the metal reserves UI with [U].

Find metal vials and create your own at alchemy stations. Discover metallic ores in the world to brew new allomantic metals.

Survive, fight, and navigate like a true Mistborn!
