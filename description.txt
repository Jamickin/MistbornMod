The Mistborn Mod brings Allomancy from Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series to Terraria!

Drink metal vials and burn metals to gain powerful abilities:
- Iron: Pull on metal objects or pull yourself to metal anchors (Hold key)
- Steel: Push on metal objects or push yourself away from metal anchors (Hold key)
- Tin: Enhanced senses with night vision and danger detection
- Pewter: Increased physical abilities including strength, defense, and speed
- Zinc: Riot the emotions of nearby enemies, making them more vulnerable
- Brass: Soothe the emotions of nearby enemies, making them less aggressive
- Copper: Hide your Allomancy from other players
- Bronze: Detect other players using Allomancy
- Atium: Become temporarily invulnerable (extremely rare)

FLARING: Press [LeftAlt] when burning metals to increase their power! 
Flaring doubles the effectiveness of all metals but also doubles consumption rate.

NEW! METAL DETECTION: Press [X] to detect nearby metals without consuming reserves!
Easily find metal objects with blue lines while exploring.

METAL RESERVES: Your body can hold a limited amount of metal! Each vial gives you 60 seconds of reserves,
and you can store up to 6 vials worth of metals total.

NEW! MISTING SYSTEM: Players now start with a random Misting ability! Use the Metal Tester to discover which metal you can burn,
or find a Lerasium Bead to become a full Mistborn.

Find metal vials and create your own at alchemy stations. Discover metallic ores in the world to brew new allomantic metals.

Survive, fight, and navigate like a true Mistborn!

Version 0.9 - Added Metal Detection feature, Misting system, and fixed multiple bugs!
